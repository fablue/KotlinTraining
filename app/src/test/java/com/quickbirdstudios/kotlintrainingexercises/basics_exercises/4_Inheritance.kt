//TODO TASK 1 create an -abstract- Animal class with a property "size" (Int)
//TODO TASK 2 add an abstract method "makeSound" (without any return value)
//TODO TASK 3 add a companion object with a property "MAX_SIZE" (=10)
//TODO TASK 4 add a method "grow" which increases the "size" of the animal IF the size is smaller than "MAX_SIZE"


// add code here for TASK 1-4...


//TODO TASK 5 create a sub class of Animal called "Bird" (calling the super constructor for the bird "size")
//TODO TASK 6 override the method "makeSound" and print the sound of a bird (which is "fiep" of course)
//TODO TASK 7 add a method "fly" which prints "flying... /^v^\\"
